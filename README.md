## The Potter Codex
This project utilises React.js, as well as react-router-dom, for page-rendering and routing. It uses axios to make API calls to the [Potter API](https://www.potterapi.com/), and I used npm and Node with Visual Studio Code in my dev environment. I also used SASS to create the stylesheet, utilising the Live Sass Compiler plugin to have it automatically compiled to CSS.
